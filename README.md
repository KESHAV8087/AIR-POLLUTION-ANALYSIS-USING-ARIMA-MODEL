# AIR-POLLUTION-ANALYSIS-USING-ARIMA-MODEL
Created and fine tuned a data analysis model using python to study the air quality index and ways on how to improve it.

Air quality is a significant issue that has long had an impact on ecosystems, plants, animals, and human health. Building, demolition, burning of plastics, and vehicular pollution are the main causes of bad air quality. A model must be created in order to periodically analyse the trends in air quality on a monthly and even seasonal basis. Time series models for analysing future air quality are discussed in this work. These models are used to project and forecast India's monthly air quality. The study analyses the air quality using time series and projects future values using and assist in enhancing or at the very least limiting the deteriorating air quality using the ARIMA model. The ARIMA model, also known as the autoregressive integrated moving average, may analyse and represent both stationary and non-stationary time series. Data on air pollution are regularly analysed using time series analysis. The ARIMA model produces satisfying and accurate results. It will help in the information gathering process so that quick action can be made to watch over and manage the situation before it becomes worse. Performance can be assessed by computing mean square error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error.
